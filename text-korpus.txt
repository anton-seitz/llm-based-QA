Judo
Judo (柔道, Jūdō, "gentle way") is a Japanese martial art, combat sport, and Olympic discipline emphasizing grappling, throws, and submissions. Founded in 1882 by Jigoro Kano, it evolved from jujutsu schools like Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū and Kitō-ryū. Unlike its predecessors, judo prioritizes "randori" (free sparring) over kata (pre-arranged forms) and excludes striking or weapons training.
Principles & Philosophy

Judo is built on two core principles:

    Seiryoku-Zenyo (精力善用) – Maximum efficiency, minimal effort.
    Jita-Kyoei (自他共栄) – Mutual welfare and benefit.

These principles extend beyond combat and serve as a model for personal development.
Competitive Judo

Judo competitions focus on scoring via:

    Ippon: Full-point win (clean throw, submission, or 20-second pin).
    Waza-ari: Half-point (lesser throw or 10–19 second pin).
    Golden Score: Sudden-death overtime if scores are tied.

Matches are governed by the International Judo Federation (IJF), with standardized weight classes and rules.
Techniques (Waza)

Judo techniques are categorized into:

    Nage-waza (Throws): Divided into te-waza (hand techniques), koshi-waza (hip techniques), and ashi-waza (foot techniques).
    Katame-waza (Grappling techniques): Includes osaekomi-waza (pins), shime-waza (chokes), and kansetsu-waza (joint locks).
    Atemi-waza (Striking techniques): Used only in kata, not in competition.

Kata (Forms)

Kata are structured demonstrations used to preserve techniques and philosophy. The ten recognized by the Kodokan include:

    Nage-no-kata (Throwing forms)
    Katame-no-kata (Grappling forms)
    Kime-no-kata (Self-defense techniques)

Judo in the Olympics & Global Influence

Judo debuted at the 1964 Olympics for men and in 1992 for women. It has influenced numerous martial arts, including Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, and mixed martial arts (MMA).
Judo Styles & National Variations

Different regions have developed unique judo styles:

    Kosen Judo: Focuses on groundwork (ne-waza).
    Russian Judo: Incorporates Sambo techniques.
    French Judo: Emphasizes grip fighting and tactics.
    Georgian & Azerbaijani Judo: Uses powerful unorthodox grips and counters.

Rank System & Judogi

Judo practitioners, known as judoka, wear a judogi with a colored belt signifying rank:

    Kyū ranks: Beginner to brown belt.
    Dan ranks: Black belt levels (1st to 10th dan).

Safety & Training

Judo training includes ukemi (breakfalls) to ensure safe practice. Dangerous techniques like small joint manipulations are restricted in competitions.
Organizations

The International Judo Federation (IJF) oversees global competition, while the Kodokan Judo Institute remains the historical authority.

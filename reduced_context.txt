Judo (柔道, jūdō), meaning "gentle way", is a modern Japanese martial art and combat sport, that originated in Japan in the late nineteenth century. Its most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the object is to either throw one's opponent to the ground, pin the opponent to the ground, or force an opponent to submit by a joint lock or choke. Strikes as well as weapons defences are a part of Judo, but only in pre-arranged forms (kata) and are not allowed in Judo competition or free practice[1].

Techniques are generally intended to turn an opponent’s force to one’s own advantage rather than to oppose it directly. A ritual of courtesy in practice is intended to promote an attitude of calm readiness and confidence. The usual costume, known as jūdōgi, is a loose jacket and trousers of strong white cloth. White belts are worn by novices and black by masters, with intermediate grades denoted by other colours. Jūdōka (students of judo) perform the sport with bare feet.

The judogi is made from a heavy weave to withstand the stress of throwing and grappling.

Judo is a hierarchical art, where seniority of judoka is designated by what is known as the kyū (級, kyū) -dan (段, dan) ranking system. This system was developed by Jigoro Kano and was based on the ranking system in the board game Go.[118]

Judo (Japanese: 柔道, Hepburn: Jūdō, lit. 'gentle way') is an unarmed modern Japanese martial art, combat sport, Olympic sport (since 1964), and the most prominent form of jacket wrestling competed internationally.[3][4][5] Judo was created in 1882 by Kanō Jigorō (嘉納 治五郎) as an eclectic martial art, distinguishing itself from its predecessors (primarily Tenjin Shinyo-ryu jujutsu and Kitō-ryū jujutsu) due to an emphasis on "randori" (乱取り, lit. 'free sparring') instead of kata (形, kata, pre-arranged forms) alongside its removal of striking and weapon training elements.[3][4][6] Judo rose to prominence for its dominance over established jujutsu schools in tournaments hosted by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department (警視庁武術大会, Keishicho Bujutsu Taikai), resulting in its adoption as the department's primary martial art.[4][3] A judo practitioner is called a "judoka" (柔道家, jūdōka), and the judo uniform is called "judogi" (柔道着, jūdōgi, lit. 'judo attire').

Judo was originally considered to be a form of Jujutsu and was known as Kano Jujutsu, though it came to be considered a separate martial art[2][3][4]. The practicers of this discipline are called "judoka" (柔道家, "judo performer")[5], and the judo uniform is called "judogi" (柔道着 or 柔道 衣 , "judo attire")[6].
History

This competitive spirit can be seen in the change in the attitude of many jūdōka in regard to scoring. Only clean throws demonstrating superior timing and a knowledge of body mechanics were rewarded with a score in the pre-Olympic period. Currently in judo, the scoring system awards an ippon (“one point”) for a conclusive technique that wins a match by its successful execution, a waza-ari (half point), and minor points (called yuko). In a major shift from traditional judo, in a modern match a jūdōka will often play conservatively and work for a win based only on partial scores from minor points, rather than risking all in the attempt for an ippon. This shift to competitive judo has been aided by the success of European and Russian jūdōka, influenced by their strong wrestling traditions and in particular the Russian development of sambo (which was itself based upon judo).

Chapter 2
The History of Kodokan Judo
The art of Jujutsu has many variations of the art, which leads to a diversity of approaches. Jujutsu schools (ryū) may
utilize all forms of grappling techniques to some degree (i.e. throwing, trapping, joint locks, holds, gouging, biting,
disengagements, striking, and kicking). In addition to jujutsu, many schools teach the use of weapons. While armed
and unarmed combat has been around for the entire history of mankind, it has been suggested that Jujutsu, as a
formal means of teaching, has been around for 600 to 1,000 years.
Judo, meaning "gentle way", is a modern martial art, combat and Olympic sport created in Japan in 1882 by Jigoro
Kano. Its most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the objective is to either throw or takedown an
opponent to the ground, immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a pin, or force an opponent to submit
with a joint lock or a choke. Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defenses are a part of Judo,
but only in pre-arranged forms (kata) and are not allowed in Judo competition or free practice (randori). A Judo
practitioner is called a Judoka.
The philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for Judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial
arts that developed from koryu, traditional schools. The worldwide spread of Judo has led to the development of a
number of offshoots such as Sambo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
The early history of Judo is inseparable from its founder, Japanese polymath and educator Jigoro Kano, (1860-
1938), born Shinnosuke Kano. Kano was born into a relatively affluent family. His father, Jirosaku, was the second
son of the head priest of the Shinto Hiyoshi shrine in Shiga Prefecture. He married Sadako Kano, daughter of the
owner of Kiku-Masamune sake brewing company and was adopted by the family, changing his name to Kano, and
ultimately became an official in the Bakufu government.
Jigoro Kano had an academic upbringing and, from the age of seven, he studied English, Japanese calligraphy and
the Four Confucian Texts under a number of tutors. When he was fourteen, Kano began boarding at an English-
medium school, Ikuei-Gijuku in Shiba, Tokyo. The culture of bullying endemic at this school was the catalyst that
caused Kano to seek out a Jujutsu dojo (training place) at which to train.
Early attempts to find a jujutsu teacher who was willing to take him on met with little success. With the fall of the
Tokugawa shogunate in the Meiji Restoration of 1868, jujutsu had become unfashionable in an increasingly
westernized Japan. Many of those who had once taught the art had been forced out of teaching or become so
disillusioned with it that they had simply given up. Nakai Umenari, an acquaintance of Kano's father and a former
soldier, agreed to show him kata, but not to teach him. The caretaker of his father's second house, Katagiri Ryuji,
also knew jujutsu, but would not teach it as he believed it was no longer of practical use. Another frequent visitor to
Kano's father's house, Imai Genshiro of Kyushin-ryu school of jujutsu, also refused. Several years passed before he
finally found a willing teacher.
In 1877, as a student at the Tokyo-Kaisei school (soon to become part of the newly founded Tokyo Imperial
University), Kano learned that many jujutsu teachers had been forced to pursue alternative careers, frequently
opening Seikotsu-in (traditional osteopathy practices). After inquiring at a number of these, Kano was referred to
Fukuda Hachinosuke (c.1828-1880), a teacher of the Tenjin Shin'yo-ryu of jujutsu, who had a small nine mat dojo
where he taught five students. Fukuda is said to have emphasized technique over formal exercise, sowing the seeds
of Kano's emphasis on randori (free practice) in Judo.
On Fukuda’s death in 1880, Kano, who had become his keenest and most able student in both randori and kata (pre-
arranged forms), was given the densho (scrolls) of the Fukuda dojo. Kano chose to continue his studies at another
Tenjin Shin'yo-ryu school, that of Iso Masatomo (c.1820-1881). Iso placed more emphasis on the practice of kata,
and entrusted randori instruction to assistants, increasingly to Kano. Iso died in June 1881 and Kano went on to
study at the dojo of Iikubo Tsunetoshi (1835-1889) of Kito-ryu. Like Fukuda, Iikubo placed much emphasis on
randori, with Kito-ryu having a greater focus on nage-waza, throwing techniques.

In February 1882, Kano founded a school and dojo at the Eisho-ji, a Buddhist temple in what was then the Shitaya
ward of Tokyo (now the Higashi Ueno district of Taite ward). Iikubo, Kano's Kito-ryu instructor, attended the dojo
three days a week to help teach. Two years would pass before the temple would be called by the name Kodokan
("place for expounding the way") and although Kano had not yet received his Menkyo (certificate of mastery) in
Kito-ryu, this is now regarded as the Kodokan founding.
The Eisho-ji dojo was a relatively small affair, consisting of a twelve mat training area. Kano took in resident and
non-resident students, the first two being Tsunejiro Tomita and Shiro Saigo. In August, the following year, the both
Tomita and Saigo were granted shodan (first rank) grades, the first that had been awarded in any martial art.
Central to Kano's vision for Judo were the principles of seiryoku zen'yo (maximum efficiency, minimum effort) and
jita kyoei (mutual welfare and benefit). He illustrated the application of seiryoku zen'yo with the concept of ju yoku
go o seisu, softness controls hardness.
In short, resisting a more powerful opponent will result in your defeat, while adjusting to and evading your
opponent's attack will cause him to lose his balance, his power will be reduced, and you will defeat him. This can
apply whatever the relative values of power, thus making it possible for weaker opponents to beat significantly
stronger ones. This is the theory of ju yoku goo seisu. Kano realized that seiryoku zen'yo, initially conceived as a
jujutsu concept, had a wider philosophical application. Coupled with the Confucianist-influenced jita kyoei, the
wider application shaped the development of Judo from a martial art to a martial way. Kano rejected techniques that
did not conform to these principles and emphasized the importance of efficiency in the execution of techniques. He
was convinced that practice of jujutsu while conforming to these ideals was a route to self-improvement and the
betterment of society in general. He was, however, acutely conscious of the Japanese public's negative perception of
jujutsu. Kano believed that "jujutsu" was insufficient to describe his art: although Jutsu means “art” or "means", it
implies a method consisting of a collection of physical techniques. Accordingly, he changed the second character to
do, meaning way, road or path, which implies a more philosophical context than jutsu and has a common origin with
the Chinese concept of tao. Thus Kano renamed it Judo.

Judo practitioners traditionally wear white uniforms called keikogi (稽古着, keikogi, practice clothing) or jūdōgi (柔道着, judogi, judo clothing)[112] sometimes abbreviated in the west as "gi". It comprises a heavy cotton kimono-like jacket called an uwagi (上衣, jacket), similar to traditional hanten (半纏, workers' jackets) fastened by an obi (帯, obi, belt), coloured to indicate rank, and cotton draw-string zubon (ズボン, trousers).[113] Early examples of keikogi had short sleeves and trouser legs and the modern long-sleeved judogi was adopted in 1906.[114]

Judo’s direction has changed since its inception. Kanō designed judo to be a safe, cooperative method of physical education. Jūdōka spend a great amount of time learning to fall safely. Even in randori, the person performing the throw (the tori) helps the person receiving (the uke) to the ground by holding onto his arm and guiding him to a safe fall. By contrast, in Western wrestling one does not help an opponent to fall, and coaches spend little if any time teaching their wrestlers how to fall safely. As judo competitions became more popular, however, jūdōka began to exhibit the competitive spirit more usually found in Western wrestlers; they began concentrating on judo as a sport rather than as a drill or a way of life. The inclusion of judo in the Olympic Games marked the turning point in this transformation.

This is a list of judo techniques. They are categorized into throwing techniques (nage-waza), grappling techniques (katame-waza), body-striking techniques (atemi-waza), blocks and parries (uke-waza), receiving/breakfall techniques (ukemi), and resuscitation techniques (kappo).

Kano's vision for judo was one of a martial way that could be practiced realistically. Randori (free practice) was a central part of judo pedagogy and shiai (competition) a crucial test of a judoka's understanding of judo.[107] Safety necessitated some basic innovations that shaped judo's development. Atemi waza (striking techniques) were entirely limited to kata (prearranged forms) early in judo's history. Kansetsu waza (joint manipulation techniques) were limited to techniques that focused on the elbow joint. Various throwing techniques that were judged to be too dangerous to practice safely at full force, such as all joint-locking throws from Jujutsu, were also prohibited in shiai. To maximise safety in nage waza (throwing techniques), judoka trained in ukemi (break falls) and practiced on tatami (rice straw mats).[citation needed]

Initially considered as a self-defence system, judo is step by step recognized for its educational value, its benefits for the development of the body and the character.

Judo's philosophy revolves around two primary principles: "Seiryoku-Zenyo" (精力善用, lit. 'good use of energy') and "Jita-Kyoei" (自他共栄, lit. 'mutual welfare and benefit').[4][7][8][9][10] The philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from Ko-ryū. Judo has also spawned a number of derivative martial arts around the world, such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Krav Maga, sambo, and ARB. Judo also influenced the formation of other combat styles such as close-quarters combat (CQC), mixed martial arts (MMA), shoot wrestling and submission wrestling.

Thanks to the efforts of Kano and his disciples, Kodokan Judo, developed within the Japanese emigrant communities (USA, Brazil, Canada) as well as in Germany, Britain and the British-influenced countries.

Commonly described as a separate style of Judo, Kosen judo is a competition rules set of Kodokan judo that was popularized in the early 20th century for use in Japanese Special High Schools Championships held at Kyoto Imperial University.[82] The word "Kosen" is an acronym of Koto Senmon Gakko (高等専門学校, literally "Higher Professional School"). Currently, competitions are organized between Japan's seven former Imperial Universities and referred to as Nanatei Judo (ja:七帝柔道, literally "Seven Emperors Judo"). Kosen judo's focus on newaza has drawn comparisons with Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
Freestyle Judo

The objective of competitive judo is to throw an opponent, immobilize them with a pin, or force an opponent to submit with a joint lock or a choke. While strikes and use of weapons are included in some pre-arranged forms (kata), they are not frequently trained and are illegal in judo competition or free practice.[4] Judo's international governing body is the International Judo Federation, and competitors compete in the international IJF professional circuit.

Kata (形, kata, forms) are pre-arranged patterns of techniques and in judo, with the exception of elements of the Seiryoku-Zen'yō Kokumin-Taiiku, they are all practised with a partner. Their purposes include illustrating the basic principles of judo, demonstrating the correct execution of a technique, teaching the philosophical tenets upon which judo is based, allowing for the practice of techniques that are not allowed in randori, and to preserve ancient techniques that are historically important but are no longer used in contemporary judo.[46]

In May 1882 Jigoro Kano was inspired by traditional forms of combat to create a method of physical, intellectual and moral education, which he named judo.

Judo has become a top sport in Israel only recently. Israeli Judo is characterized by a particular emphasis on hip throws, which are executed with a mix of technique and aggression, with the practitioner that has to adjust his sleeves before powerfully gripping and throwing the opponent away.[99][100]
Sambo

The international governing body for judo is the International Judo Federation (IJF), founded in 1951. Members of the IJF include the African Judo Union (AJU), the Pan-American Judo Confederation (PJC), the Judo Union of Asia (JUA), the European Judo Union (EJU) and the Oceania Judo Union (OJU), each comprising a number of national judo associations. The IJF is responsible for organising international competition and hosts the World Judo Championships and is involved in running the Olympic Judo events.[117]

Judo pedagogy emphasizes randori (乱取り, literally "taking chaos", but meaning "free practice"). This term covers a variety of forms of practice, and the intensity at which it is carried out varies depending on intent and the level of expertise of the participants. At one extreme, is a compliant style of randori, known as Yakusoku geiko (約束稽古, prearranged practice), in which neither participant offers resistance to their partner's attempts to throw. A related concept is that of Sute geiko (捨稽古, throw-away practice), in which an experienced judoka allows himself to be thrown by his less-experienced partner.[44] At the opposite extreme from yakusoku geiko is the hard style of randori that seeks to emulate the style of judo seen in competition. While hard randori is the cornerstone of judo, over-emphasis of the competitive aspect is seen as undesirable by traditionalists if the intent of the randori is to "win" rather than to learn.[45]

A practitioner of judo is known as a judoka (柔道家). The modern meaning of "judoka" in English is a judo practitioner of any level of expertise,[110] but traditionally those below the rank of 4th dan were called kenkyu-sei (研究生, trainees); and only those of 4th dan or higher were called judoka. (The suffix -ka (家), when added to a noun, means a person with expertise or special knowledge on that subject).

Cuban Judo is characterized by an explosive and high athletic style that puts an emphasis on body conditioning and calculated planning mixed with raw power. In terms of training the athletes use a particularly methodical and intellectual approach to the sport.[95][96]

Gokyo-no-waza (五教の技, Five sets of techniques) is yet another subcategorization of nage-waza into 5 main groups, as well as groups of preserved techniques (habukareta-waza) and new techniques (shinmeisho-no-waza). This grouping has been made for pedagogical purposes ("Learning the throws in order is the key to mastery."[4]).
Nage-waza (投げ技): throwing techniques
Judo Nage-waza
Tachi-waza (立技): standing techniques
Te-waza (手技): hand throwing techniques

Kano believed that "jūjutsu" was insufficient to describe his art: although jutsu (術) means "art" or "means", it implies a method consisting of a collection of physical techniques. Accordingly, he changed the second character to dō (道), meaning "way", "road" or "path", which implies a more philosophical context than jutsu and has a common origin with the Chinese concept of tao. Thus Kano renamed it Jūdō (柔道, judo).[27]

Although taught within kata (型 or 形) and sometimes used within informal randori (乱取), striking techniques are forbidden in standard judo competitions rules.
Ude-ate-waza (腕当て技): arm striking techniques
Kobushi-ate-waza: fist techniques

A judoka's position within the kyu-dan ranking system is displayed by the color of their belt. Beginning students typically wear a white belt, progressing through descending kyu ranks until they are deemed to have achieved a level of competence sufficient to be a dan grade, at which point they wear the kuro obi (黒帯, black belt). The kyu-dan ranking system has since been widely adopted by modern martial arts.[119]

There are three basic categories of waza (技, techniques) in judo: nage-waza (投げ技, throwing techniques), katame-waza (固技, grappling techniques) and atemi-waza (当て身技, striking techniques).[28] Judo is mostly known for nage-waza and katame-waza.[29]

For events organized under the auspices of the International judo Federation (IJF), judogi have to bear the IJF Official Logo Mark Label. This label demonstrates that the judogi has passed a number of quality control tests to ensure it conforms to construction regulations ensuring it is not too stiff, flexible, rigid or slippery to allow the opponent to grip or to perform techniques.[116]

    Jigorō Kanō (Japan, 1860–1938) founded judo, and established the Kōdōkan in 1882. Judo was the first Japanese martial art to gain widespread international recognition, and the first to become an official Olympic sport. Kanō was also a pioneer of international sports. Accomplishments included being the first Asian member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). His official honours and decorations included the First Order of Merit and Grand Order of the Rising Sun and the Third Imperial Degree. He was inducted to the IJF Hall of Fame on 14 May 1999.[1] The IJF Hall of Fame was established in 1999.[1][2]

An adoption of Kano jiu jitsu (a common name for judo at the time) in Brazil attributed to Mitsuyo Maeda's students,[103] most notably the Gracie family.[104][105] 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu and other wrestling-influenced systems without the gi have also become popular.[106]
Other styles

Freestyle Judo is a form of competitive judo practiced primarily in the United States that retains techniques that have been removed from mainstream IJF rules.[83] Freestyle Judo is currently backed by the International Freestyle Judo Alliance (IFJA). The Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) officially sanctions Freestyle Judo in the United States of America.[84]
Georgian Judo

Both judo and jiu-jitsu originated on the island nation of Japan. However, jiu-jitsu is significantly older than judo and is the mother fighting style that judo evolved from. Jiu-jitsu, also known as jujutsu or “the gentle art”, was an unarmed fighting technique that was originally taught to the elite samurai warrior caste to use in case they were separated from their weapon.
The Rise of Judo From Jiu-Jitsu

Judo also influenced other combat styles such as close-quarters combat (CQC), mixed martial arts (MMA), shoot wrestling and submission wrestling.
Safety

In 1877, as a student at the University of Tokyo, Kano learned that many jujutsu teachers had been forced to pursue alternative careers, frequently opening Seikotsu-in (整骨院, traditional osteopathy practices).[14] After inquiring at a number of these, Kano was referred to Fukuda Hachinosuke (c. 1828–1880),[15] a teacher of the Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū of jujutsu, who had a small nine mat dōjō where he taught five students.[16] Fukuda is said to have emphasized technique over formal exercise, sowing the seeds of Kano's emphasis on randori (乱取り, randori, free practice) in judo.
